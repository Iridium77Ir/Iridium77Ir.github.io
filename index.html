    <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://iridium77ir.github.io/art.nikober.xyz">ART - a collection of generative art</a></h4>
    <p>These mostly animated pieces of generative art were created using P5JS, a simple framework designed for 2D and 3D rendering in the browser using javascript and the canvas element.</p>

    <p>The origin of this project lies within a school project for which we had to create pieces of art, any kind, and present them. I thought of this as an opportunity to further my skills and promptly began to create the first pieces, mostly modified versions of existing work. The Youtube Channel "The coding Train", which is run by a Daniel Schiffmann, one of the creators of Processing the older version of P5, written in Java, was a great source of inspiration.</p>
